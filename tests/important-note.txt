To test async functions. we need to test them as 
await expect().resolves.not.toBeNull() 
like this 

we must connect our test methods to database 
thats how we will be able to test resolver functions .. 
when we are connected to database already


always Remember jest.fn()
                jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(value)
                jest.fn().mockReturnedValue(value)
// one example is in authMiddleware Test
// and second example is in nestjs-postgres-rest // repo from github 

// many jest things are in that repo // i can get help from there
