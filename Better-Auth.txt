I have implemented like a user model will have all task Ids in it 
so whenever i have to get Tasks , 
i will have to find user first , from req.userId 
and then i will have to find tasks, from the taskIds, came from user 

so i should do something like , 
whenever creating a task, i can add a property init as userId: req.userId
so i can get the tasks as 
Task.find({userId: req.userId})

-- with a single Query





NEXT TIME I HAVE TO DO LIKE THIS ,
STORE USERID IN EVERY TASK OR STUDENT 
AND THEN FIND THEM AS TASK.find({ USERID: req.userId}) 
WITH A SINGLE QUERY


SEE THE DIFFERENCE BTW GETSTUDENTS QUERY AND GETALLTASKS QUERY, WE WILL FOLLW GETALLTASKS QUERY STYLE
